\details{

Given a general linear model, the interest is in simultaneous confidence intervals
for several ratios of linear combinations of the coefficients in the model. It is assumed that the
responses are normally distributed with homogeneous variances. In this problem, the joint distribution
of the likelihood ratio statistics has a multivariate t-distribution
the correlation matrix of which depends on the unknown ratios. This means that the critical
point needed for CI calculations also depends on the ratios. There are various methods
of dealing with this problem (for example, see Dilba et al., 2006). The methods include (i) the unadjusted
intervals (Fieller confidence intervals without multiplicity adjustments), (ii) Bonferroni (Fieller
intervals with simple Bonferroni adjustments), (iii) MtI (a method based on Sidak and Slepian
inequalities for two- and one-sided confidence intervals, respectively), and (iv) plug-in (plugging
the maximum likelihood estimates of the ratios in the unknown correlation matrix). The MtI method consists
of replacing the unknown correlation matrix by an identity matrix of the same dimension.

Applications include relative potency estimations in multiple parallel line or slope-ratio assays.
Users need to define the design matrix of the linear model and the corresponding contrast matrices 
in an appropriate way.
