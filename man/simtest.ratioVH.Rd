\title{Approximate simultaneous tests for ratios of normal means with heterogeneous variances}

\description{
  Performs simultaneous tests for several ratios of linear combinations of treatment means in a normal one-way layout,
 assuming normal distribution of the data allowing heterogeneous variances.
 
}
\usage{
simtest.ratioVH(formula, data,
 type = "Dunnett", base = 1, alternative = "two.sided",
 Margin.vec = NULL, FWER = 0.05,
 Num.Contrast = NULL, Den.Contrast = NULL,
 names = TRUE)
}


\arguments{
  \item{formula}{A formula specifying a numerical response and a grouping factor (e.g., response ~ treatment)}
  \item{data}{A dataframe containing the response and group variable} 
  \item{type}{type of contrast, with the following options:}
  \itemize{
    \item "Dunnett": many-to-one comparisons, with control in the denominator
    \item "Tukey": all-pair comparisons
    \item "Sequen": comparison of consecutive groups, where the group with lower order is the denomniator
    \item "AVE": comparison of each group with average of all others, where the average is taken as denominator
    \item "Changepoint": ratio of averages of groups of higher order divided by averages of groups of lower order
    \item "Marcus": Marcus contrasts as ratios
    \item "McDermott": McDermott contrasts as ratios
    \item "Williams": Williams contrasts as ratios
    }
 Note: type is ignored if Num.Contrast and Den.Contrast are specified by the user (See below).

  \item{base}{ a single integer specifying the control (i.e. denominator) group for the Dunnett contrasts, ignored otherwise}
  \item{alternative}{a character string:}
    
    \itemize{
    \item "two.sided": for two-sided tests
    \item "less": for lower tail tests
    \item "greater": for upper tail tests
}
  \item{Margin.vec}{a single numerical value or vector of Margins under the null hypotheses, default is 1}
  \item{FWER}{a single numeric value specifying the family-wise error rate to be controlled}
  \item{Num.Contrast}{Numerator contrast matrix, where columns correspond to groups and rows correspond to contrasts}
  \item{Den.Contrast}{Denominator contrast matrix, where columns correspond to groups and rows correspond to contrasts}
  \item{names}{a logical value: if TRUE, the output will be named according to names of user defined contrast or factor levels}
  
}

\details{
The associated ratio test statistic T[i] has a t-distribution. Multiplicity adjustment is achieved by using quantiles of r r-variate t-distributions, which differ in the degree of freedom and share the correlation structure. The compariso-specific degrees of freedom
are derived using the approximation according to Satterthwaite (1946).
