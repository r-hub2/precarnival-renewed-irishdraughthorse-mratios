\title{ Simultaneous confidence intervals for ratios of linear combinations of means }

\description{
  This function constructs simultaneous confidence intervals for ratios of linear combinations of normal means in a one-way ANOVA model.
  Different methods are available for multiplicity adjustment.

\details{

Given a one-way ANOVA model, the interest is in simultaneous confidence intervals
for several ratios of linear combinations of the treatment means. It is assumed that the
responses are normally distributed with homogeneous variances. Unlike in multiple testing
for ratios, the joint distribution of the likelihood ratio statistics has a multivariate t-distribution
the correlation matrix of which depends on the unknown ratios. This means that the critical
point needed for CI calculations also depends on the ratios. There are various methods
of dealing with this problem (for example, see Dilba et al., 2006). The methods include (i) the unadjusted
intervals (Fieller confidence intervals without multiplicity adjustments), (ii) Bonferroni (Fieller
intervals with simple Bonferroni adjustments), (iii) MtI (a method based on Sidak and Slepian
inequalities for two- and one-sided confidence intervals, respectively), and (iv) plug-in (plugging
the maximum likelihood estimates of the ratios in the unknown correlation matrix). The latter
method is known to have good simultaneous coverage probabilities. The MtI method consists
of replacing the unknown correlation matrix of the multivariate t by an identity matrix of the
same dimension.

See the examples for the usage of Numerator and Denominator contrasts.
Note that the argument names Num.Contrast and Den.Contrast need to be specified. If numerator and denominator contrasts are plugged in without
their argument names, they will not be recognized.
