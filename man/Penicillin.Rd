\title{Comparing 6 strains with respect to production of antibiotics }
\description{
The production of antibiotics of 6 strains (mutants of the same micro organism) was compared. MO were put to holes in agar infected with Bacteria.
 The diameter of Baceria-free areas around the colonies of the MO was recorded. Each strain was repeated 8 times.
