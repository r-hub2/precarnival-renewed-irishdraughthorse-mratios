\title{ Mutagenicity assay }
\description{
  Mutagenicity assay for 4 doses of a compound (hydroquinone) against a negative (vehicle) control and a positive (active) control (cyclophosphamide). 
  Hydroquinone was applied in doses of 30, 50, 70, 100 mg/kg, positive control was applied with 25mg/kg.
  Counts of micronuclei in polychromatic erythrocytes after 24h are taken as a measure for the potency to induce chromosome damage. Data of male mice are presented
 (Hauschke et al., 2005).
}
\usage{data(Mutagenicity)}
