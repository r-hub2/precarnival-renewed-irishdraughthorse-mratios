\description{
 With this package, it is possible to perform (simultaneous) inferences for ratios of linear combinations of coefficients in the
          general linear model. In particular, tests and confidence interval estimations for ratios of
          treatment means in the normal one-way layout and confidence interval estimations like in (multiple) slope ratio
          and parallel line assays can be carried out. Moreover, it is possible to calculate the sample sizes required in comparisons
          with a control based on relative margins. For the simple two-sample problem, functions for a t-test for ratio-formatted
          hypotheses and Fieller confidence intervals are provided assuming homogeneous or
          heterogeneous group variances.
